# Notes for using Bitbucket git service

I'm new to programming and this is my first project on Bitbucket, so I put some usage hints here.

Set up Git on your machine if you haven't already.

	mkdir /path/to/your/project
	cd /path/to/your/project
	git init
	git remote add origin https://ninedeck@bitbucket.org/ninedeck/dbtester.git

Create your first file, commit, and push

	echo "Henry Wang" >> contributors.txt
	git add contributors.txt
	git commit -m 'Initial commit with contributors'
	git push -u origin master
